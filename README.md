## Project Overview

This is a Health Tracker App built with a Rails API (see my other repo [health-tracker-rails](https://github.com/ninalouw/health-tracker-rails)) and React with Redux on the Front-End.
It is inspired by the [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/app) app, and allows users to track and visualize their calorie intake and their weight over time. It also allows them to set calorie and weight targets. It will use the [Nutrionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/) to fetch calorie data.
