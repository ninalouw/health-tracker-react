## Project Overview

This is a Health Tracker App built with a Rails API (see my other repo [Health_Tracker_API]()) and React with Redux on the Front-End.
It is inspired by the [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/app) app, and allows users to track and visualize their calorie intake, their weight, and the amount of exercise that they do. It also allows them to set calorie, exercise and weight goals. It will feature illustrations designed by me in Illustrator.
